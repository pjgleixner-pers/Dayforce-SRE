-- 1. Retrieve the Sales table data with only the sales_id, store_id and sales_amount columns.
--SELECT sales_id,store_id,sales_amount FROM Sales

-- 2. Retrieve all of the sales for the 'Pink' store for 2019 in Mexico (all columns from the Sales and Store tables).
--select * from sales inner join  Store on sales.store_id = store.store_idwhere store.store_name Like '%Pink%' and sales.country Like '%Mexico%' and sales.year = 2019

-- 3. Retrieve the total number of sales per store for the year 2019 (store_id, total_sales).
--select COUNT(*) as total_sales,  sales.store_id from sales  inner join  Store on sales.store_id = store.store_id where sales.year = 2019 group by sales.store_id


-- 4. Retrieve the store_names which had more than 1 sales for the year 2019 (store_name, count_of_sales).
--select store.store_name , COUNT(*) as total_sales from sales  Full outer join  Store on sales.store_id = store.store_id where sales.year = 2019  group by sales.store_name


-- 5. Create an index on Sales that would make your query from Question 2 more efficient. 
select * from sales inner join  Store on sales.store_id = store.store_id where store.store_name Like '%Pink%' and sales.country Like '%Mexico%' and sales.year = 2019
